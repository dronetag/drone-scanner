# Drone Scanner
Drone Scanner is an application for scanning surroundings for data broadcasted by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, such as identification and location. It gathers the data and presents them to user on map.

Drone Scanner can track all the nearby flights over Direct Remote ID standards. Browse real-time data about drones on a detailed map highlighting specific flying space zones. 

The application was inspired by [OpenDroneID Android receiver application](https://github.com/opendroneid/receiver-android).
